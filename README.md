# Basic OpenGL with GLFW: 2D Normal Mapping

You might not have expected this, but normal maps can also be applied to 2D sprites.
This demo combines elements used in the previous sprite batching and normal mapping demos.

# Setup

You will need to have CMake installed on your computer, and properly added to your path.

Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.
